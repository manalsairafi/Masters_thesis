# Masters_thesis
This repository contains the files used for my Masters thesis project on simulating processes from the Scotogenic model for dark matter and neutrino masses.

**Abstract**

**Files**
* analysis.py : Python code to generate exclusion plots for the analysis of the results.
* PDG_MC_numbering.txt : a .txt file with the PDG codes of the SM and MScM particles used in analysis.py.
* MScM_eta : LO UFO formatted file for the model with $\eta^0_R$ as the dark matter candidate.

**Note**
See thesis Appendix E for how the UFO files are generate for LO and NLO calculations.
